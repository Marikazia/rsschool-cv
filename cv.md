#### About Me
----
I am a half creative person. He worked in the specialty for 9 years. I have been thinking about changing my field of activity for a long time, but fears that it is not mine, that I will not succeed, have prevailed. One day I decided to let go of my fears and start learning programming. I started with video tutorials mostly from YouTube ... I'm currently working on a portfolio and taking courses at https://www.freecodecamp.org and here https://app.rs.school. I hope the result will be worth it.
